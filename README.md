Marble-Mystic
=============

It is a board game(logical) for one player involving movement of marbles on a board with single empty space.(Populary known as Peg Solitare or BrainVita in India.) Not Enough? Download and play the game. You just need a browser!.

It is my first JS gimmick. Just thought of sharing it with open world.
